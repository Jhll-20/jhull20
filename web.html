        <h3>Introduction</h3><p>   There are 1.1 billion websites on the World Wide Web. Many of these sites have images, designs, and other interactive features. The web has 3 major milestones: Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0. Each milestone marks a monumental phase of the web, showcasing the difference in advancement and features such as the advancement of browsers alongside it. Each of these evolutions has created precedents that have drastically altered the way we interact with the web as a whole. </p>
        <h3> Web 1.0</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">"Web 1.0 (Web1), also known as the Static Web, is the term used to describe the first iteration of the internet. It describes the web between the 1990s and early 2000s" ( Ledger, 2023.) Web 1.0 utilized static pages, the pages were on a read-only basis. These sites utilized linear navigation and minimal user-created content. The minimalist nature of Web 1.0 created a platform for information sharing but minimal social aspects and user-generated content.</p>
        <img src="https://anicholson19936.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/apple_1473503a.jpg" atl="Web 1.0 Static page" style="width:400px;height:200px;">
        <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Web 2.0 began in the early 2000s and continues to be the current version of the internet. Web 2.0 provides user-generated and promotes social networking and media. This was the start of social media, blogs, and other media-sharing networks, causing a great wave of communities to be built. Web pages are no longer static and are composed of interactive web pages and apps with live updates. "While connecting people directly, Web 2.0 also revolutionized access to information and cultural output. Sudden abundance diluted gatekeeper monopolies previously held by printers, publishers, record labels, and studios. Infinite digital shelf space and distribution costs nearing zero fueled an explosion of niche media and individual expression" (History Tools, 2024.) Myspace, Facebook, TikTok, etc are platforms that have elevated the social ecosystem across the Web. Businesses have majorly changed their approaches by utilizing social media influences to advertise products and exploiting the centralization of Web 2.0 to create algorithms and advertisements based on user data. </p>
        <img src="https://anicholson19936.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/untitled-1.jpg" atl="Web 2.0 Static Page" style="width:500px;height:350px;">
        <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">The evolution of Web 3.0 has not officially started, yet there is a lot more complexity to it in comparison to its predecessors. Web 3.0 looks to incorporate features such as tokenization, decentralization, AI, and blockchain. "In this version of the internet, users are meant to have greater control over their data instead of it being shared with companies that monetize personal information. The result is intended to be an interactive internet experience with increased ownership and privacy of personal data" (Coursera Staff, 2024.) Web 3.0 focuses on shifting from the centralized ecosystem corporations benefit from through user data, to decentralizing those sources and providing privatization and incentives to the users. Unlike the previous evolutions, Web 3.0 is still in development and holds uncertainty for many.  Obstacles such as regulation, legal jurisdictions, energy consumption, and user usability remain unclear. Web 3.0 aims to accomplish and combine features that are far more complex and require much more understanding and time to develop.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Naturally, as evolution continues within the web other advancements follow each evolution. Browsers are one of those advancements that have advanced right aside from the web. The first browser was created by Marc Andreessen in the 1990s. NCSA Mosaic introduced graphical interfaces that laid the foundation for present-day websites today. In 1994, Andreessen collaborated with Silicon Founder Jim Clark to create Netscape. Netscape drew emphasis to the graphic and interactive designs utilizing hypertext and other multimedia forms. The establishment of Internet Explorer followed about a year after that and marked a pivotal milestone for browsers. After the development of Internet Explorer followed by bigger competitors such as  Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. Browsers now in Web 2.0 incorporate features like customizable plugins, ad and traffic blockers, and other features to set them apart. More corporations created browsers that aligned with their company and features. </p>
